Searching files:

	grep [pattern] [files]						you can do this directly on files or just pipe output to grep
		-i										ignore case (uppercase and lower are counted the same)
		-v										Exclude the lines that match (ie all the lines that don't match)
	eg:
		cat catfile|grep -i "Dog"				
		
	sed 's/<search pattern>/<replace pattern>/[option]'		edit lines coming in and change 1 pattern to another
	eg:
		echo "the cat sat on the mat"|sed 's/cat/dog/'		replace cat with dog.
		echo "the cat sat on the chair"|sed 's/c/go/'		try this - only replaces 1st instance of the pattern
		echo "the cat sat on the chair"|sed 's/c/go/g'		last value g=global, replace all instances of "c"
